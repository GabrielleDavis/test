## Conferences

![](project4_image.jpg)
One thing about me is that I always take advantage of every conference
and symposium I can attend! In the photo above, Iâ€™m at a conference in
Cleveland where we competed in a two-minute poster pitch to showcase the
importance of our research. It was a fantastic opportunity to refine our
skills and engage in some friendly competition.

The next photo was taking at ABRCMS - Annual Biomedical Research
Conferences for Minoritized Scientist. I attend this conference along
with my Case PREP Scholar group. This conferences was such an amazing
opportunity. I was able to expand my knowledge of all types of research
that ranged from neuroscience to public health! In addition, this
conference was a fantastic way to connect with graduate schools.
Numerous schools visited and there was a tons of graduate program
directors were there! I was able to talk to directors, faculty, and
students! I remember I had a long conversation with a student from
University of Michigan (UMich), and the conversation had such a positive
impact on me! It's awesome to know that I will be attending that school
apart of there Fall 2025 cohort!
