# Welcome to my blog!

A particular chapter I want to focus on is “Scientific Talks” from Jeff Leeks on how to be a modern scientist. Currently, most of the talks I have given have been presentations for journal clubs, a poster at a conference, or my work for a symposium day. As I transition into graduate school, I have been curious about what it is like to be a keynote speaker. In addition, if someone is selected for an oral presentation at a large-scale event, how can we make sure the message is delivered effectively and accurately? 

I think the use of links is a touchy subject within the presentation realm. It can be very hard for someone to remember the link if they want to copy it down, and even harder for them to remember where they put that paper. Therefore, contrary to Jeef Leek's suggestion of a “short and sweet” link, I prefer to use QR codes. QR codes are an extremely simple way of spreading a message fast, and to my knowledge, a majority of phones can scan QR codes.

In this section, I liked how he referred to figures a lot. I think 

I particularly liked one second: “That one person who keeps going bonkers on you.” I have bad anxiety whenever I am presenting, even though I love what I do. However, I have been in situations where an individual is “going bonkers,” and I handled the situation to the best of my ability. I think Jeff Leek's suggestion of “You are bringing up a lot of good issues, I’d be happy to discuss with you after the presentation more in depth, but in the interest of time I’m going to move on to the next part of my talk” (CITE).
