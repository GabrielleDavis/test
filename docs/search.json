    "text": "LinkedIn\n  \n  \n    \n     Email\n  \n\n\n\n\nWelcome to my website!\nGreetings!\nHello! My name is Gabrielle Davis, and I am currently a post-baccalaureate student at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). During my time here, I’ve been dedicated to researching the association between type 2 diabetes and cancer. After I got my bachelors of science in Biology from Penn State University (PSU), I knew that I wanted to pursue bio-medical related research. I was fortunate enough to discover this area of research when I rotated in Dr.Schumachers lab. As of right now, we are looking at the effects of standard and newer treatments and how they reduce the risk of the cancer in someone diagnosed with T2D. Head over to my projects page to learn more!\nMy research journey has been filled with many areas of research. My freshman year I tested the pH saliva and how glucose has an impact on it. Then I joined a research team where I had the ability to annotate photos, and it was compiled into an AI information system. And the information was used to help farmers in third world countries battle pest diseases and high temperatures! Then I had the summer research oppuruntunity to through the McNair Scholars program to research spotted lanternflies! This experience was life-changing, I learned so much about research as a whole, and the dedication graduate students put into their PhD. Although this experience was fun, I realized entomology wasn’t my preferred research area. Head over to my projects page to learn more!\nOutside of being a scholar, I am a sister, daughter, and granddaughter. Family is a huge part of my life. My mom, sister, and grandma have always taught me to remain humble and treat others as I would want to be treated. I am first-generation student, and I am biracial. I am Pureto Rican, Native American, and Black. One of my favorite things is being apart of such a blended family. Coming from such a diverse background allows me to bring a unique perspective to my academic and professional work life.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions!!"

    "text": "Globally, the Global Burden of Disease estimated more than 462 million people were affected by Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), a metabolic disorder, and projected the prevalence rate to increase from 6,059 T2D cases per 100,000 in 2017 to 7,079 per 100,000 in 2030. Effective management of T2D consists of insulin therapy and other anti diabetic (non-insulin) treatments prescribed by a healthcare professional. Currently, nearly one million deaths are attributed to T2D, and when left unmanaged, it contributes to elevated risks for diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, and periodontal disease. The relationship between T2D and cancer is more complicated where previous publications report an elevated risk for liver and pancreas cancer and a decreased risk for breast and prostate cancer. The driver of these associations is unclear - T2D treatments or the disease. Here, we address a scientific gap quantifying strata-specific associations between T2D therapies and cancer risk by sex, self-reported race, and clinical-demographic factors (i.e. years of T2D, age of cancer onset, cancer stage, etc.). We hypothesize that T2D treatment profiles mediate cancer risk differently by cancer site, and more importantly by known cancer risk factors. We are developing a retrospective cohort using TriNetX, a real-world electronic health record database, to assess the correlation between T2D treatment profiles (insulin vs non-insulin) and cancer risk. In the United States, patients over the age of 18, diagnosed with T2D prior to the index period, and prescribed T2D medications during the index period (2005 -2018) are observed for a cancer outcome. The T2D prescription cohorts (e.g. insulin vs non-insulin) are propensity score matched (1:1) based on factors such as sex, self-reported race, and other demographic variables, and hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) were computed to determine associations. Strata-specific results are presented. Our findings will determine the impact of T2D management on cancer risk across several risk strata and elucidate the scope of T2D therapy on individual cancer risk. Our analytical strategy to assess strata-specific effects will be used to inform cancer screening and prevention strategies for targeted at-risk populations and further advance the concept of personalized medicine."

    "text": "Toxin Sequestration and Natural Predators of the Spotted Lantern Fly\n\n\n\nBanner Image\n\n\nThe rapid expansion of the invasive spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula, SLF) across the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states in the USA has markedly impacted the grape, forest, and ornamental industries, requiring a massive effort to decrease SLF populations and its economic impacts. The primary approach to manage SLF has been the use of synthetic insecticides, which can have negative effects on non-target arthropods, the environment, and humankind. Natural enemies such as predators could offer a safer management strategy. However, SLF sequester toxins from their preferred host, tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima, TOH), which can render these pests unpalatable to some types of predators. Using SLF reared on TOH or grapevines (an alternative preferred host), we conducted a study to determine if birds could distinguish between SLF that had fed on TOH vs. grape, and if so, would they show a preference for SLF fed on grape. We observed nest boxes used by several bird species to see if the birds would eat SLF provided in cups on top of the boxes, feed them to their young, or dispose of them (drop them on the ground). Then using the statistical package R, we compared birds’ behavior on the two different SLF diets using Chi-square tests. Although our research is not complete, we predict that birds will feed more on SLF that have not had access to TOH to their chicks than the SLF that had access to TOH. In our study, we will focus on the adult bird’s behavior, and observe if they consume the SLF, feed the SLF to their chicks, or discard the SLF. Watching the bird’s behavior will allow us to determine if they are natural predators against the SLF population."

    "text": "Welcome to my blog!\n\nDate: March 11th, 2025\nAuthor: Gabrielle Davis\nA particular chapter I want to focus on is “Scientific Talks” from Jeff Leeks on how to be a modern scientist. Currently, most of the talks I have given have been presentations for journal clubs, a poster at a conference, or my work for a symposium day. As I transition into graduate school, I have been curious about what it is like to be a keynote speaker. In addition, if someone is selected for an oral presentation at a large-scale event, how can we make sure the message is delivered effectively and accurately?\nI think the use of links is a touchy subject within the presentation realm. It can be very hard for someone to remember the link if they want to copy it down, and even harder for them to remember where they put that paper. Therefore, contrary to Jeef Leek’s suggestion of a “short and sweet” link, I prefer to use QR codes. QR codes are an extremely simple way of spreading a message fast, and to my knowledge, a majority of phones can scan QR codes.\nIn this section, I liked how he referred to figures a lot. I think\nI particularly liked one second: “That one person who keeps going bonkers on you.” I have bad anxiety whenever I am presenting, even though I love what I do. However, I have been in situations where an individual is “going bonkers,” and I handled the situation to the best of my ability. I think Jeff Leek’s suggestion of “You are bringing up a lot of good issues, I’d be happy to discuss with you after the presentation more in depth, but in the interest of time I’m going to move on to the next part of my talk” (CITE)."
