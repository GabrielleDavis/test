PENN STATE UNIVERSITY: 

I began my higher education journey at Penn State University - University Park, where I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Biology in May 2024. During my time at PSU, I actively participated in various events and had the opportunity to meet a diverse group of people. Attending such a dynamic and opportunity-rich institution allowed me to explore numerous aspects of research, ultimately solidifying my passion for continued scholarly inquiry. This experience has inspired me to pursue a PhD and further advance my research career.

CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY

Currently, I am completing my time as a Case PREP Scholar at CWRU. This is a phenomenal opportunity that has allowed me to pursue biomedical science research. My current project focuses on the intersection between cancer and obesity and treatments that can potentially reduce an individual with diabetes risk of cancer.

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN: 

I am excited to announce I will be continuing my journey at University of Michigan. I am so excited, and I can't wait to see the opportunities waiting for me. This second will be updated once I start my rotations and first week of classes! 

And of course, Go Blue!
