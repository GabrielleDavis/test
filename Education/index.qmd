# PENN STATE UNIVERSITY

## 2020 - 2024

I began my higher education journey at Penn State University - University Park, where I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology in May 2024. During my time at PSU, I actively participated in various events and had the opportunity to connect with a diverse group of individuals. Attending such a dynamic institution, rich with opportunities, allowed me to explore different facets of research. This experience has inspired me to pursue a doctoral degree and further advance my research career.

# CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY

## 2024-2025

Currently, I am working as a Case PREP Scholar at CWRU. This is an incredible opportunity that has allowed me to dive into biomedical science research. My current project focuses on the intersection between cancer and obesity, specifically investigating treatments that could potentially reduce the risk of cancer in individuals with diabetes.

# UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN

## 2025 - 2030 

I’m excited to announce that I’ll be continuing my journey at the University of Michigan! I was excepted into their Programs in Biomedical Science (PIBS) PhD Umbrella program. I am so excited, and I worked so hard for this moment. I can’t wait to see the opportunities that await me. This section will be updated once I begin my rotations and finish my first week of classes.

Fun fact, when I called my mom and to let her know I got into this program, she started hugging random people in Tj Maxx because she was so happy!

And of course, Go Blue!
