## Impact of Insulin and Non-Insulin Diabetic Treatment on Cancer Incidence in Patients Diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes

![](project_2_banner.png){width="100%" height="300px"}

*Globally, the Global Burden of Disease estimated more than 462 million
people were affected by Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), a metabolic disorder, and
projected the prevalence rate to increase from 6,059 T2D cases per
100,000 in 2017 to 7,079 per 100,000 in 2030. Effective management of
T2D consists of insulin therapy and other anti diabetic (non-insulin)
treatments prescribed by a healthcare professional. Currently, nearly
one million deaths are attributed to T2D, and when left unmanaged, it
contributes to elevated risks for diabetic nephropathy, diabetic
retinopathy, and periodontal disease. The relationship between T2D and
cancer is more complicated where previous publications report an
elevated risk for liver and pancreas cancer and a decreased risk for
breast and prostate cancer. The driver of these associations is
unclear - T2D treatments or the disease. Here, we address a scientific
gap quantifying strata-specific associations between T2D therapies and
cancer risk by sex, self-reported race, and clinical-demographic factors
(i.e. years of T2D, age of cancer onset, cancer stage, etc.). We
hypothesize that T2D treatment profiles mediate cancer risk differently
by cancer site, and more importantly by known cancer risk factors. We
are developing a retrospective cohort using TriNetX, a real-world
electronic health record database, to assess the correlation between T2D
treatment profiles (insulin vs non-insulin) and cancer risk. In the
United States, patients over the age of 18, diagnosed with T2D prior to
the index period, and prescribed T2D medications during the index period
(2005 -2018) are observed for a cancer outcome. The T2D prescription
cohorts (e.g. insulin vs non-insulin) are propensity score matched (1:1)
based on factors such as sex, self-reported race, and other demographic
variables, and hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) were computed to
determine associations. Strata-specific results are presented. Our
findings will determine the impact of T2D management on cancer risk
across several risk strata and elucidate the scope of T2D therapy on
individual cancer risk. Our analytical strategy to assess
strata-specific effects will be used to inform cancer screening and
prevention strategies for targeted at-risk populations and further
advance the concept of personalized medicine.*

## Toxin Sequestration and Natural Predators of the Spotted Lantern Fly

![](project_1_banner.png){width="100%" height="300px"}

*The rapid expansion of the invasive spotted lanternfly (Lycorma
delicatula, SLF) across the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states in the
USA has markedly impacted the grape, forest, and ornamental industries,
requiring a massive effort to decrease SLF populations and its economic
impacts. The primary approach to manage SLF has been the use of
synthetic insecticides, which can have negative effects on non-target
arthropods, the environment, and humankind. Natural enemies such as
predators could offer a safer management strategy. However, SLF
sequester toxins from their preferred host, tree of heaven (Ailanthus
altissima, TOH), which can render these pests unpalatable to some types
of predators. Using SLF reared on TOH or grapevines (an alternative
preferred host), we conducted a study to determine if birds could
distinguish between SLF that had fed on TOH vs. grape, and if so, would
they show a preference for SLF fed on grape. We observed nest boxes used
by several bird species to see if the birds would eat SLF provided in
cups on top of the boxes, feed them to their young, or dispose of them
(drop them on the ground). Then using the statistical package R, we
compared birds’ behavior on the two different SLF diets using Chi-square
tests. Although our research is not complete, we predict that birds will
feed more on SLF that have not had access to TOH to their chicks than
the SLF that had access to TOH. In our study, we will focus on the adult
bird’s behavior, and observe if they consume the SLF, feed the SLF to
their chicks, or discard the SLF. Watching the bird’s behavior will
allow us to determine if they are natural predators against the SLF
population.*
